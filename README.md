# rust-from-ocaml

This is a series of build scripts to bootstrap rustc from the last OCaml version. They have been tested to work on x86-64 Ubuntu 20.04 LTS. The series currently ends at the 2014-01-20 snapshot. To run, execute each script in order, starting from `build0`, which downloads all needed dependencies.

With the exception of data copied from third-party sources in the patch content, all scripts are marked CC0 1.0: see `COPYING` for more information.
